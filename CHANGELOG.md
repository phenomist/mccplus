## Ron's branch

### 30.2.0
* Added automatic update to raid name dropdown list once per hour, incase player changes rank, this way user does not need to restart everytime they change rank
* For the moment there is still 1 popup that could not be entirely gotten rid of, you may see a black box appear then disappear, this is due to how the game is set up and lag time between client and server.
* Currently this is not the most efficient script, maybe someone can find a better way to handle the popups, but it is functional, cuts raid time from 2-3 seconds to about 1 second.

### 30.1.0
* Raid messages now goto text box instead of popup
* Raid message history is maintained for current session only

### 30.0.0
* 1-click raiding added â€“ thanks RonBurgundy
* Do not spam the button, otherwise no name will be entered to raid, need to wait at least 1 second between clicks do to server lag.
