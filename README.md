An addon for A Mining Game, formerly known as Minecraft Clicker.

I will make this look better when I am not sleep-deprived and have time.

Ron's Branch

30.0

-- 1-click raiding added â€“ thanks RonBurgundy

-- do not spam the button, otherwise no name will be entered to raid, need to wait at least 1 second between clicks do to 
server lag.

30.1

-- raid messages now goto text box instead of popup

-- raid message history is maintained for current session only

30.2

-- added automatic update to raid name dropdown list once per hour, incase player changes rank, this way user does not need 
to restart everytime they change rank

-- for the moment there is still 1 popup that could not be entirely gotten rid of, you may see a black box appear then 
disappear, this is due to how the game is set up and lag time between client and server.

-- currently this is not the most efficient script, maybe someone can find a better way to handle the popups, but it is 
functional, cuts raid time from 2-3 seconds to about 1 second.

31

-- Major: Added RonBurgundy's 1-click raid code

31.1

-- Refactored dialog parsing + autoclick into more efficient JQuery

31.2

-- Dragory updates shortenAmount

31.3

-- Added some GB policing

-- Hopefully Reset works now

-- Removed some extraneous HTML in the 1-click raid box

-- 1-click raid box no longer reports defenses

31.4 a.k.a. x10pi

-- 1-click raid drop down now remembers last selected player on hourly update(assuming they are still a valid target in range)

-- 1-click raid textbox is adjustable for height and width, default is 5x40:

-- updated link for raid info to goto user specific page

31.5

-- silence

32

-- Major: Shortcuts box

-- Moved 1-click raid to shortcuts box

-- Added a clear raid dialogbox button

-- chatbot fix

-- ">def"

-- ">load"

32.1

-- Hot-loading code still has some issues, hack should kinda prevent that from happening post 32.1

-- moar shortcut box hax

32.2

-- Throttled MCC+bot to 2s/msg
